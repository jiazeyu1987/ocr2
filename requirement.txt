# Python 3.10/3.11 runtime dependencies (Windows)
#
# Notes about PaddlePaddle:
# - CPU: keep `paddlepaddle` as-is.
# - GPU: replace `paddlepaddle` with the correct `paddlepaddle-gpu` wheel for your CUDA version
#   (Paddle provides version-specific wheels; do not mix CPU+GPU wheels).

# Core
# OpenCV 4.12+ requires NumPy 2.x on Windows; pin OpenCV < 4.12 to stay on NumPy 1.26.x.
numpy==1.26.4
opencv-python<4.12

pillow

# OCR
# PaddleOCR 3.x pulls in PaddleX/ModelScope/PyTorch; on Windows this often fails due to PyTorch DLL deps.
# Keep PaddleOCR on 2.x for this project.
paddleocr<3

# Image diff / experiments
matplotlib
# PaddleOCR currently pulls in newer SciPy/skimage versions that expect NumPy 2.x ABI.
# Pin to NumPy 1.x compatible wheels for Python 3.10 on Windows.

# Shapely 2.x wheels are often built against NumPy 2.x ABI; this project pins NumPy<2, so keep Shapely <2.
